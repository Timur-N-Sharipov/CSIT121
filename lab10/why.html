            <p>The Web Cryptography API is important because it increases the security of web applications, allowing them to protect sensitive data directly within the browser using standardized cryptographic methods. This means that sensitive information such as personal details, passwords, and credit card information can be securely processed before being sent over the web. This helps keep sensitive information safe from unauthorized users, protects users from data breaches and in general ensures your information is kept confidential and secure. Because Web Cryptography is standardized by W3C, it is a consistent way for all modern browsers to handle encryption.</p>
