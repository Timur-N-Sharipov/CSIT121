        <h2 id="website-info"> Website information</h2>

        <h3>What is the URL of the website?</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.groundcontrolom.com/" target="_blank">www.groundcontrolom.com</a></p>

        <h3>What is the name of the website?</h3>
        <p>The full name is Ground Control Owings Mills</p>

        <h3>Who is the sites target audience?</h3>
        <p>The target audience is people who want to get into training a combat sport, or in general want to improve their fitness. In the website they provide a list of the programs</p>

        <h3>How is the site organized?</h3>
        <p>The layout of the website is hierarchical organization. They have a define homepage and links to different section like information about the instructors, schedule and classes.</p>


        <h2 id="design">Design Principles</h2>

        <h3>Which CRAP Design Principles does it use?</h3>
        <p>The CRAP design they use is repetition. On the home page they have the different names of the programs they offer in bold font, and underline.</p>

        <h3 id="audit-score">What is the audit score?</h3>
        <p>According to the accessibility checker the audit score is 35%. The biggest issue was contrast between the foreground and background colors. In my opinion the red, white, and black colors they use may not match well together, but it is the theme color of their brands logo and thus the color choices on the webpage match it.</p>

        <h3>What is the sites efficiency?. Can users perform tasks quickly?</h3>
        <p>In my opinion the website is efficient, you can easily find information about classes, instructors and the scheadule via the links provided in the navigation menu at the top. If you sroll down on the home page there is no large blocks of text, its mainly images with a text description making browsing and understanding easy.</p>

        <h3>How is the engagement? Is it pleasant and appropriate for its industry?</h3>
        <p>Navigating the website is simple and engagement is easy, you are only a click away to learn more, you can scroll down to see images from their classes or you can input your information for them to reach out to you. Yes in my opinion it is appropriate for its industry, it is not an educational site but a promotion for their business to attract new customers. A person interested can easily navigate links, find more information, see pictures from the gym and easily sign up for a trial. </p>

        <h2 id="recommendation">Recommendations</h2>
        <p>I actually think the website is good to promote a local business. The design is not complex to navigate, but one recommendation I have is to use smaller fonts. The webpage uses alot of large fonts for their text making  them take up alot of space and thus on the webpage you have to scroll down alot to go through the whole thing.</p>
