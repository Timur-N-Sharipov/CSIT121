        <h2>Putting time in</h2>
        <p>The biggest thing is that web development takes time.
          <br>
          I learned that in order to make good webpages it requires alot of time put into it. I can require multiple hours for basic webpages, or days to weeks for more advanced webpages. You should try not to get everything done in one day and instead put a little bit of time everyday which will take you far.

          <h2>Reuse Code</h2>
          <p>Reusing code is a big help. Maybe from old projects or from another source you found on the internet. Reusing old code can help you save time, and it gives you a foundation to work from, instead of starting from zero. For example, reusing a table from one of your old projects.

            <h2>Use Resources!</h2>
            <p>Coding can be overwhelming. There is alot of syntax, rules and different languages that are used today. The good news is you dont have to memorize it all, you just have to learn the basics and from there you can use online resources to build off and help you. There are many free resources like W3 Schools, MDN Doc, and YouTube that you can use to help you with your projects.
