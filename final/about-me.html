          I am a student here in the Community College of Baltimore County. This semester I took a class named CSIT 121, in this class we learned the standard web technologies that are used in modern web development. And now I will use my new gained knowledge to develop my own ePortfolio!

            Hi, my name is Timur (tea-more) and I just finished my CSIT 121 class on web standards and I'm currently working on building my own functional webpage. I like when webpages are not cluttered, visually pleasing and are easy to navigate. One of my goals here was to design mines with good UI and UX in mind.
            <br>
            I use technology to improve my productivity and workflow by using tools that help me learn, stay organized and keep track of my personal goals. Outside of technology I like to spend time in nature and train mixed martial arts.

            Throughout my semester I learned the web standard technologies and had to use my knowledge to create webpages, they were called labs. From learning how to build a basic HTML page, then styling it with CSS and lastly adding some functionality with JavaScript. Click the link below to check out all my labs and their functions.
