            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello and welcome to my web page. My name is Timur, and I am a student at the Community College of Baltimore County. I recently learned how to publish a file on a web server using GitHub. If you are seeing this, that means I have successfully published this file. I think I have gotten the hang of it but still need to practice it a couple more times and I also need to learn and get comfortable with how to navigate and use the interface of GitHub as it is a bit confusing as of now. I have watched a YouTube video tutorial and plan to do the same again to really familiarize myself with GitHub as it is a popular platform for developers
                <br>
                I am a part time student working towards earning my associate degree in Information Technology. I have an interest in technology as seeing how rapidly it is evolving and how it is being used today. We are currently at a point where we can generate AI photos and videos and people online are having a hard time distinguishing if it is real or not. My goal is to learn more about technology and use it to benefit my day to day life, improve my work flow and my creative output.
