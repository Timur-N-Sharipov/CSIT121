            <h3>Resources</h3>
            <p>Learning about HTML, the different tags, and how to properly use them is a big step. As well as learning how to style your HTML using CSS, and knowing its syntax. Coding is vast and you don't need to memorize it all. You just have to understand the general concept of marking up content in a structured way, and how you want your webpages style and layout to look. From there you use code references to help you. These resources below helped aid my learning and understanding and can do the same for you: </p>
